# Access Travel SDK on React Native

## Quickstart for devs üõ†Ô∏è

We use yarn `4.7.0` for this, which you can install with `yarn set version berry`. Install dependencies with `yarn install`.

From there, you can create a development build with `yarn ios`. This will build and initialize the app on a simulator you specify.

Lastly, you must replace the session token that is hard-coded in the webview component with one that you generate yourself. We default to using the staging endpoint(s), but feel free to swap this out for the production endpoints.
